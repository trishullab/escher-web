							One of the grand challenges in the artificial intelligence is to find an AI scientist:
							an
							artificial agent that can automatically design, test, and infer scientific hypotheses
							from
							data. The scientific discovery process can be broken down into six distinct steps. Let's
							begin by understanding these steps with a concrete example: Kepler's discovery of the
							laws
							of planetary motion. A more complete
							description of this example is found in "The Astronomical Revolution: Copernicus-
							Kepler-Borelli" by Alexandre Koyr√©.

					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							The first step in the scientific discovery process is to observe a phenomenon that is
							unexplained by the leading scientific theories. In our example, the leading theory --
							Aristotle's geocentric model -- failed to explain the retrograde motion of Mars as it moved
							across the night sky.

					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							Once an anomaly is observed, the next step is to propose a new theory that can explain the
							phenomenon. In our example, Copernicus hypothesized a heliocentric model of the solar
							system, where the planets revolve around the sun. The relative motion of the planets in this
							model can explain the retrograde motion of Mars.

					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							A theory is incomplete without empirical evidence to support it. In our example, Tycho Brahe
							meticulously collected data on the positions of the planets in the night sky. Notice that
							Brahe collected more readings when he believed, intuitively, that the retrograde motion of
							Mars was most pronounced. This is an important distinction in data collection for scientific
							discovery: there is always an 'importance bias' in the data collection process.

						<p>
							Johannes Kepler then cleaned and analyzed the data collected by Brahe. Kepler tried various
							geometric shapes to fit the data, and found that an ellipse fit the data best. This
							empirical discovery enabled deducing relationships between the orbital duration
							and the orbital radius.

					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							Kepler's work in moving the empirical data into a set of mathematical relationships paved
							the way for broader interpretation. For instance, Newton validates his laws of motion and
							his law of universal gravitation by showing that the empirical relationships discoverd by
							Kepler are a consequence of his laws. In this way, the interpretation of empirical law in
							one
							phenomena often generalizes to and explains other phenomena that didn't have a-priori data
							collection mechanisms.

					<h3 class="title is-size-6-mobile is-size-4-tablet">Symbolic Regression</h3>
					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							This paper focuses on just one subtask in the scientific discovery process: <strong>symbolic
								regression</strong>. Symbolic regression is the task of finding a mathematical
							expression that best fits a given dataset. The goal is to find a compact, interpretable
							expression that can be used to make predictions and infer new relationships. Symbolic
							regression is a key tool in scientific discovery, as it can help uncover hidden
							relationships in the data and suggest new hypotheses to test.
							<br />
							Kepler's discovery of the empirical laws of planetary motion is considered one of the
							earliest examples of symbolic regression.
